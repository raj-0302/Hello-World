Hello Humans,

I happened to be there for the Chinese Newyear.The year I went to HonkKong was the 'year of dog'.We stayed in one of the tallest hotel in the world (Ritz carlton).Everyyear when Chinese newyear come,I used to think of my travel to HonkKong.I wish I would be able visit again HongKong sometime in my life.
